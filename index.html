			<p style="text-align: center">Hey.</p>
			<p class="emphasis">This is the SolemnSky project: an endeavour to bring a game called <a href="http://altitudegame.com">altitude</a> into a brighter future.</p>
            <p> Our immediate goal is to make an open source 2d multiplayer plane game that cuts few corners in technical development and supports extensive modding. Game design with an orientation for competitive play is on our minds. </p>
            <p> We have chosen Haxe for its robust support of many target platforms. </p>

			<p class="italics"> Altitude is an unfortunately small 2d multiplayer game release in 2009. Its premise is simple, but it has supported an infrastructure of competitive play and demonstrated the potential of a sparsely inhabited genera. We intend to build on the principles of altitude to bring a new and interesting competitive game to a wider scene of players. </p>
