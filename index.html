			<p style="text-align: center">Hey.</p>
			<p class="emphasis">You're on the website of the SolemnSky project, an endeavour to bring <a href="http://altitudegame.com">altitude</a> into the future.</p>
			<p> Our immediate goal is to make an open source multiplayer game inspired by altitude with the capacity to be modified easily by anybody who knows javascript. Our longer term goals will involve using a community-backed effort to bring the wonderful mechanics of altitude to a wider audience, enriched with new improved game design. </p>
			<p> After a series of technical considerations, we have decided to proceed with development in the promising language / framework of Haxe. </p>

			<p class="italics"> The developers of altitude always made the game they wanted, and we respect them for exactly that; they took a unique and interesting vision that nobody had thought to ask for and packaged it in a 2d cartoon plane game with appearances that decieve and potential that inspired years of competitive play. They showed us what's possible, and now it's our turn to take the torch and present the ideals of altitude to another "generation" of players. </p>
